# Overview

* This application uses the google speech to text engine to transcribe speech 
* The aim of this application is to port functionality to a more finished site to enable audio assisted commands 
* It currently runs fine locally, however remote access is compromised as google speech to text api endpoint fails to authenticate using the .json key file 
    * The fix for this will be deployed soon
